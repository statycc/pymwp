class Polynomial:
    """A polynomial is an ordered list of ordered Monomials.

    For polynomials, I introduce a total order on the monomials. This
    eases the computation of the sum: if we want to add a monomial to an
    ordered list of monomials, we compare the monomial to each of the
    elements of the list until we find either an element which is equal
    (and then we sum the scalars) or an element which is larger (and
    then we insert the new monomial there).

    Polynomials use the following ordering: $\\delta(i,j)$
    is smaller than $\\delta(m,n)$ iff either $j<n$ or $(j==n)$ and $(i<m)$.

    This is extended to products (which we consider ordered!) by
    letting $\\prod_k\\delta(i_k,j_k) < \\prod_l\\delta(m_l,n_l)$
    iff $\\delta(i_1,j_1) < \\delta(m_1,n_1)$.

        Here we assume at least self is a sorted polynomial,
        and the result of this operation will be sorted.

        This operation works as follows:

        1. We compute a table of all the separated products
            $P.m_1,...,P.m_n$. Each of the elements is itself
            a sorted list of monomials: $P.m_j=m^j_1,...,m^j_k$

        2. We then sort the list of the first (smallest) elements
            of each list. I.e. we sort the list $m^1_1,m^2_1,...,m^n_1$
            and produce the list corresponding list of indexes of
            length n, I.e. a permutation over ${0,...,n}$.

        3. Once all this preparatory operations are done, the main part
           of the algorithm goes as follows:

        4. We consider the first element — say j — of the list of indexes
           and append to the result the first element of the corresponding
           list $P.m_j$ of monomials.

        5. We remove both the first element of the list of index and
           the first element of $P.m_j$.

        6. If $P.m_j$ is not empty, we insert j in the list of index
           at the right position: for this we compare the (new) first
           element of $P.m_j$ to  $m^{i_2}_1$ (as we removed the
           first element, $i_2$ is now the head of the list of indexes),
           then $m^{i_3}_1$, until we reach the index h such that
           $m^{i_h}_1$ is larger than $m^{j}_1$.

        7. We start back at point 4. Unless only one element is left
           in the list of indexes. In this case, we simply append the
           tail of the corresponding list to the result.

        Arguments:
            polynomial: polynomial to multiply with self.

        Returns:
            A new polynomial that is the sorted product of the two input
