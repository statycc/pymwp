    Relation list holds a list of [`Relations`](relation.md).

    relations in the list.

    Attributes:
        relations (List[Relation]): List of relations.

        """To create a relations list, specify either `variables` or
        `relation_list`.

        Arguments:
            variables: List of variables used to initialize a relation on
                relation list.
            relation_list: List of relations for initializing relation list.

        Specifying a `relation_list` argument of a list of `Relations`,
        initializes a `RelationList` containing the provided relations.
        If no `relation_list` argument is provided, the constructor will
        create a relation list with one relation, using the provided
        `variables` to initialize that relation.

        Example:
            Create relation list using specific variables

            ```python
            rel_list = RelationList(['X0', 'X1', 'X2'])
            ```

            Generates a list with 1 relation:

            ```
            X0 |  +o  +o  +o
            X1 |  +o  +o  +o
            X2 |  +o  +o  +o
            ```

            Create relation list by providing relations

            ```python
            relations = [Relation(['X0', 'X1']), Relation(['X0'])]
            rel_list = RelationList(relation_list=relations)
            ```

            Generates a list with 2 relations:

            ```
            1:      X0  |  +o  +o
                    X1  |  +o  +o

            2:      X0  |  +o
            ```

            If no arguments are provided, the result is a relation list with an
            empty relation.

            ```python
            rel_list = RelationList()
            ```
