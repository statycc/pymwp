class DeltaGraph:
    """
    Delta Graph is a dictionary representing a weighted graph of tuples of
    deltas (also referenced here as a _monomial_list_, a list of Monomials
    without its scalar). We will often refer to tuple of deltas as simple
    node, but a node with length!

    Nodes are "sorted" by this length in order to be compared by chunks of
    same size.

    Weight of edge represents the index where the nodes differ.

    We use tuple because we want them to be hashable (as key in dictionary).

    Example:
        ```
                              ↓
        n1 = ((0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4))
        n2 = ((0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (0,4))
        ```

        in our graph will have:

        ```
        n1 <---- 3 ----> n2
        ```

        or

        ```python
        size = 4   ↓
        graph_dict[4][n1][n2] = 3
        ```

        The graph is symmetric:

        ```python
        graph_dict[4][n2][n1] = 3
        ```

    This representation will help us simplify the evaluation by
    removing redundant/irrelevant choices/paths.

        graph_dict (dict): Dictionary of nodes.
        degree (int): Graph degree.
