# Supported C Language Features

The table below summarizes the supported C language features pymwp can analyze.  

!!! info "Note on C file parsing"

    pymwp uses pycparser to process the C input file. Any limitation of
    pycparser is also a limitation in pymwp. From
    [pycparser website](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser):
    "pycparser aims to support the full C99 language (according to the
    standard ISO/IEC 9899). Some features from C11 are also supported."

**What happens if the C program contains unsupported syntax?** 

- By default, the analysis skips unsupported _statements_ and raises a warning.
- In strict mode (`--strict`), analysis skips whole constructs (_"programs"_) that contain unsupported syntax. 

The strict mode is sound, but not very informative in case of an unsupported program.
The default handling is more useful for developing the analysis.

[^1]: Binary operands must be variables or constants.
[^2]: Loop handling is very important in the mwp calculus. 
      A C language looping construct converts to a bounded or unbounded loop.
      A bounded loop must have form "run `X` times" and the guard variable `X` cannot occur in body.
